Gruesome v0.0.3
===============

"It is pitch black.  You are likely to eat someone..."


In Gruesome you play the grue, lurking in shadows and eating adventurers.
Explore randomly generated caverns populated with wandering adventurers,
trying to avoid the light of their torches and grabbing a bite to eat when
possible.  You can't directly move into adventurers - either hang around
hoping they'll stumble into you, or snuff out their torches with a shadow
ball spell.

 - movement with numpad or vi keys
 - </> to traverse stairs
 - 5/. to rest and gain LP
 - 'z' to use shadow ball to blind enemies (costs 2 SP)
 - 'a' to detect enemies (costs 1 SP)
 - 's' to "shadowwalk" - freeze time at the cost of LP

Source can be compiled on Linux or Mac with FPC.

I hope to make a far better version in future, with much more interesting
levels, enemies, AI, stats, magic system, etc.  But that's a long way away,
and for now it's just nice to get something released.  Have fun!
